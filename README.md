# Flatten JSON
The "main.py" file should be the program to flatten the JSON object. 
I just used the example you gave me as the JSON object.
The "myjson.json" file is the JSON file
Both "main.py" and "myjson.json" are in the same directory.
I used python to code the program so I used bash on windows terminal  --->

aceperez00@DESKTOP-1MKT991:/mnt/c/Users/acele$ cd /mnt/c/Users/acele/MongoDB_Challenge  
// Changed directory to where both of the files were

aceperez00@DESKTOP-1MKT991:/mnt/c/Users/acele/MongoDB_Challenge$ python3 main.py
